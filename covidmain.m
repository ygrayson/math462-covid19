    In this project, we plan to investigate the current situation of 
    COVID-19 using epidemic modeling. We will potentially be doing both 
    model selection and parameter estimation in order to find a good model 
    of the outbreak. One of the models that is worth trying is the SEIR 
    model that we discussed in class. We are looking at some 
    local regions in Michigan and how different regions might have a 
    different model as a good fit. With the existing data in hand, 
    we would hope to generate a good prediction into the future of the 
    outbreak.
